# Word Doc Generator
Python-based application that generates a series of .docx files in a new folder.

## Background
I'm currently studying a Masters, and I like to make notes in Word. However, I noticed that every teaching period, I'm creating a new folder, and a series of documents that all have a consistent naming convention.

Really interested in Al Sweigart's [*Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter15/), I wanted to practice using the `python-docx` library on a use case for me specifically.
